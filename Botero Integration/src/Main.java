   * Name:                Mariana Botero 
   * Program Description: The purpose of this program is to advise a user what book they should read
   *                      using data from personality questions. It manifests beginner-Java 
   *                      development techniques.
   *                      
   * Java's Eight Primitive Data Types: 
   * byte:    Can hold up to 8 bits of data and supports a range of integers with values from -128  
   *          to 127.
   *          
   * short:   Can hold up to 16 bits of data and supports a range of integers with values from 
   *          -32,768 to 32,767. 
   *               
   * int:     Can hold up to 32 bits of data and supports a range of integers with values from -231 
   *          to 231-1.   Â 
   *          
   * long:    Can hold up to 64 bits of data and supports a range of integers with values from 
   *          values of Math.pow(2, -63) to Math.pow(2, 63)-1.
   *          
   * char:    Can hold 16 bits of data represented with a Unicode character.
   * 
   * float:   Can hold up to 32 bits of data with a range of fractional numbers (decimals) from 
   *          values of 1.40 x Math.pow(10, -45) to 3.4 x Math.pow(10, 38). Typically represented 
   *          with an 'F' at the end of the number.      
   *          
   * double:  Can hold up to 64 bits of data with a range of fractional numbers (decimals) from 
   *          values of 4.94 x Math.pow(10, -324) to 1.79 x Math.pow(10, 308).
   *          
   * boolean: Can hold 1 bit of data. Has two possible values: True or False.
   * 
   * Variables and Scopes:
   * Variable: A place holder for something else; a location in memory. 
   * Scope: A variable (region or code) that is only accessible in the method it was declared.
